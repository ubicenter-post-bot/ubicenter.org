&lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next eight days, New York City Democrats will decide their party nominee for mayor. One of the candidates, former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, has centered his campaign around a shrunk-down local version of his national &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubicenter.org/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend&quot;&gt;Freedom Dividend&lt;/a&gt;, which he calls &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yangforny.com/policies/a-basic-income-for-new-york-city&quot;&gt;“A Basic Income for New York City.”&lt;/a&gt; The plan promises to provide an average of $2,000 to each of the city’s 500,000 poorest adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I explore how this $1 billion program could be codified. I find that the plan can be characterized by a benefit program that guarantees 30% of the poverty line and phases out at 50 cents per dollar of income. Such a plan would reduce deep poverty by 60%, though it would also create significant work disincentives and distort marriage choices among NYC’s deeply poor population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;poverty-in-new-york-city&quot;&gt;Poverty in New York City&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NYC has unusually high poverty: in 2019, 19.2% of the population was in poverty, compared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-272.pdf&quot;&gt;11.7% nationally&lt;/a&gt;. That’s based on the Census Bureau’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/supplemental-poverty-measure.html&quot;&gt;Supplemental Poverty Measure&lt;/a&gt; (SPM), which, unlike the Official Poverty Measure, accounts for a household’s&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in-kind benefits (e.g., food stamps), taxes, and, critically for NYC, housing costs—the SPM estimates that NYC residents face 21% higher cost of living than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NYC’s current 19.2% poverty rate is down from 23.9% when the Census Bureau began reporting the SPM, though it hit a high of 28.3% in 2012 in between. The deep poverty rate—the population share under half the poverty threshold—has followed a similar trend, from 7.8% in 2009 to a high of 9.1% in 2011 to its latest value of 4.9% in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(&quot;#graph_graph_structured_mobile_1&quot;).load(&quot;/assets/markdown_assets/yang-nyc/pov_trend.html&quot;);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;graph_graph_structured_mobile_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poverty rates fail to capture dynamics below the threshold, though. If a policy lifts someone from 10% of the poverty line to 90%, that doesn’t change the poverty rate; if it lifts them from 10% to 40%, it also doesn’t change the deep poverty rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s also useful to consider the &lt;em&gt;poverty gap&lt;/em&gt;, the sum of all deviations between a household’s resources and their poverty threshold, among families in poverty; that is, the poverty gap measures the total amount one would have to spend to end poverty, if the transfer were perfectly targeted. Similarly, the _deep poverty gap _measures deviations to half the poverty threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NYC’s poverty gap in 2019 was $6.3 billion, and its deep poverty gap was $1.5 billion. Poverty gaps are less straightforward to interpret over time, since they vary with inflation and population changes, but their pattern roughly mirrors that of the poverty rates, exhibiting modest and inconsistent declines over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(&quot;#graph_graph_structured_mobile_2&quot;).load(&quot;/assets/markdown_assets/yang-nyc/pov_gap_trend.html&quot;);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;graph_graph_structured_mobile_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To smooth out the year-by-year noise, the rest of this analysis averages the three latest years of data, from 2017 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;andrew-yangs-basic-income-proposal&quot;&gt;Andrew Yang’s Basic Income Proposal&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yang’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yangforny.com/policies/a-basic-income-for-new-york-city&quot;&gt;campaign website&lt;/a&gt; spells out core features of the plan, indicating that it would provide monthly transfers averaging $2,000 per year to the “500,000 New Yorkers with the greatest need,” that these transfers would supplement existing benefits, and that the $1 billion program intends to end “extreme poverty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document leaves some details unspecified, some of which Yang’s campaign staff clarified to me, others of which remain open questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a “New Yorker”?&lt;/strong&gt; Campaign staff defined this as an adult resident of NYC, in accordance with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robinhood.org/wp-content/themes/robinhood/images/poverty-tracker/pdfs/POVERTY_TRACKER_REPORT25.pdf&quot;&gt;poverty reporting&lt;/a&gt; from the NYC-based nonprofit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robinhood.org/&quot;&gt;Robin Hood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is poverty defined?&lt;/strong&gt; Campaign staff also confirmed to me that the poverty definitions refer to the SPM. Given SPM’s accounting of housing costs, this aligns with Yang’s statement that “Our goal is to […ensure] that every household has an annual income that is at least above extreme poverty, taking into account the true cost of living in New York City.” Robin Hood’s Poverty Tracker emulates the Census Bureau’s approach with regard to the Supplemental Poverty Measure, though its results differ.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is “extreme poverty” defined?&lt;/strong&gt; This is unclear, so I do not apply it as a defining constraint. Robin Hood’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robinhood.org/wp-content/themes/robinhood/images/poverty-tracker/pdfs/POVERTY_TRACKER_REPORT19.pdf&quot;&gt;2019 report&lt;/a&gt;, based on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robinhood.org/programs/special-initiatives/poverty-tracker/index.html&quot;&gt;Poverty Tracker&lt;/a&gt; survey produced in conjunction with Columbia University, classified 500,000 NYC adults as in “deep poverty,” under the standard poverty definition of below half the poverty line. Meanwhile, the term “extreme poverty” is typically reserved for the World Bank’s global definition of about $2 per person per day—a depth of poverty under which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w25907&quot;&gt;virtually no Americans fall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are the transfers person-based or household-based?&lt;/strong&gt; On one hand, the program is focused on “New Yorkers”—adults—but on the other, it promises to end extreme poverty, which is defined at the household level. I assume that it’s household-based, like other welfare benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is income defined for the purposes of qualifying for the benefit?&lt;/strong&gt; The emphasis on the poverty rate suggests that the income measure would be the SPM resource measure; indeed, Yang’s staff confirmed that benefits like SNAP and housing assistance would count toward eligibility (though the reverse is not true). While estimating this resource measure in real time will create administrative difficulties (as I explain later), I assume that doing so is feasible and use it for my calculations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the maximum amount of the transfer?&lt;/strong&gt; That is, how much should a household with no current income get? If the policy intends to eradicate deep poverty, then it must be at least half the household’s poverty threshold. As I show in the next section, however, this is not feasible given the $1 billion budget, so I explore smaller amounts; and as I explain later, basing the transfer on a household’s poverty threshold may create administrative challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the phase-out rate (i.e. marginal tax rate) of the transfer with respect to income?&lt;/strong&gt; Alternatively, at what income level would the program no longer cover a household? For example, if the benefit maxes out at half a household’s poverty threshold, and it phases out dollar for dollar (100% marginal tax rate), then a household whose income is half their poverty threshold would receive $0; if the marginal tax rate is 50%, they would receive $0 when their income reaches their poverty threshold. The campaign told me that it would phase out at some rate, rather than having a cliff, but they did not specify the rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, I assume that the program would guarantee a certain percentage of a household’s SPM poverty threshold and phase out at a certain rate with respect to their SPM resources. To determine the parameters that satisfy Yang’s constraints ($1 billion budget and 500,000 adult recipients), I turned to microsimulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;identifying-a-feasible-reform&quot;&gt;Identifying a feasible reform&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yang’s plan has two criteria: it must reach 500,000 adults and cost $1 billion. There are also two unknown policy parameters: the maximum value (as a share of a household’s poverty threshold), and the phase-out rate (with respect to resources). Many potential policies could satisfy either of these conditions, but only one satisfies both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider, for example, three potential phase-out rates: 25%, 50%, and 100%. The slower the phase-out, the more a given policy costs, &lt;em&gt;ceteris paribus&lt;/em&gt;; UBI, with a 0% phase-out, is the most expensive option, while a 100% phase-out is cheapest (though it removes all incentive to work). At a 25% phase-out, a benefit could only guarantee 20% of the poverty threshold while staying under the $1 billion budget. At a 50% phase-out rate, the benefit could guarantee 30% of the poverty threshold, and a 100% phase-out could guarantee 39%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(&quot;#g3&quot;).load(&quot;/assets/markdown_assets/yang-nyc/cost.html&quot;);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;g3&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reach 500,000 adults, I run the same exercise. At a 25% phase-out, the benefit can only max out at 15% of the poverty threshold. At 50%, it’s 30%, and at 100%, it’s well over 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(&quot;#g4&quot;).load(&quot;/assets/markdown_assets/yang-nyc/reach.html&quot;);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;g4&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining these constraints, we can map the contours that satisfy each condition. This reveals that the policy that satisfies both (a) guarantees 30% of the poverty line, and (b) phases out at 50 cents per dollar of income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(&quot;#g5&quot;).load(&quot;/assets/markdown_assets/yang-nyc/cost_reach.html&quot;);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;g5&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-reforms-impact&quot;&gt;The reform’s impact&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poverty rates are ill-suited to evaluating policies that target the deeply poor population the way this does. Since the reform fully phases out for families with resources of 60% of their poverty threshold, it leaves the poverty rate unchanged. This demonstrates limitations of the poverty rate as a policy evaluation tool: it fails to capture reductions in the extent of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the deep poverty rate largely fails to capture the policy’s impact. The benefit is 83% phased out for families at the deep poverty threshold (50% / 60%), so while it does have some effect, the bulk of the impact is in reducing the depth of deep poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy most affects the deep poverty gap—lowering it by 60%—which makes sense given it aims to reduce the depth of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(&quot;#g6&quot;).load(&quot;/assets/markdown_assets/yang-nyc/impacts.html&quot;);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;g6&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;administrative-and-incentive-considerations&quot;&gt;Administrative and incentive considerations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this plan would achieve significant deep poverty reduction, it may also face administrative challenges, and it would certainly create perverse incentives for recipients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basing the monthly program on SPM resource values would be difficult. SPM resources include all cash income, as well as in-kind benefits and taxes throughout the year. That means that program officers would have to estimate households’ annual income, benefits, and taxes, each month to determine their payment amount. Recipients would face this administrative burden as well, having to report any change to income, benefits, projected tax liability, or household structure to the city. Tax liability aside, this is largely consistent with other benefit programs, though those other benefit programs do fail to reach some of the poor, and these hoops plausibly explain some of those exclusion errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program would add 50 percentage points to recipients’ marginal tax rates. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/aspe-files/260661/brief2-overviewmtranalyses.pdf&quot;&gt;Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;, most households below 75% of the poverty line (as would be targeted by this program) currently face marginal tax rates of 10% or less. However, by changing that from 10% to 60%, or even 0% to 50%, the program would make the deeply poor population some of the highest taxed segment of the population. Studies find that workers in the lowest income decile are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/10-25-2012-Labor_Supply_and_Fiscal_Policy.pdf&quot;&gt;most sensitive to marginal tax rates&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that labor supply would fall as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-06-15-yang-nyc/aspe_hhs_mtr.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program would also distort marriage incentives, both toward and away from it. For example, someone with no income would gain a larger benefit from staying single than from partnering with someone with income; on the other hand, two people with similar income may gain a larger benefit from partnering, depending on their poverty threshold. This also is not a problem that’s new either to benefit programs or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://taxfoundation.org/understanding-marriage-penalty-and-marriage-bonus/&quot;&gt;tax code&lt;/a&gt;, but the generosity of the payment and steep phase-out make the issue especially prominent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A policy consistent with Andrew Yang’s policy outline would reduce deep poverty by 60%, largely helping people escape the deeper depths of poverty that cause lasting harms, especially to children. The sharp means-testing could make it harder to reach eligible recipients, and it will distort those recipients’ incentives, but providing cash transfers without a work requirement across NYC would constitute a new step toward an unconditional safety net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Throughout this analysis, I use “household” as shorthand for Supplemental Poverty Measure unit, a household-like concept created by the Census Bureau to group (actual) household members that share resources. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://requirejs.org/docs/release/2.3.5/minified/require.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, we published an &lt;a href=&quot;/lib-dem-policy-paper&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of universal basic income reforms described in the Liberal Democrat UBI Working Group’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/libdems/pages/1811/attachments/original/1621669347/145_-_Universal_Basic_Income.docx_%281%29.pdf?1621669347&quot;&gt;discussion paper&lt;/a&gt;. In the working group’s words, their paper “is designed to stimulate debate and discussion within the Party and outside; based on the response generated and on the deliberations of the working group a full policy paper will be drawn up and presented to Conference for debate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this follow-up, we model a budget-neutral version of the reforms put forth in the working group paper, as well as a variety of (also budget-neutral) adjustments to those reforms. While the working group’s reform would reduce poverty and inequality, we find that these adjustments, which make the UBIs more generous and inclusive, would augment their effects substantially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-working-groups-ubi-reform&quot;&gt;The working group’s UBI reform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The working group paper suggested a range of UBI amounts: 45, 60, 75, and 95 pounds per week for working-age adults. The cost was partly offset by lowering the annual Personal Allowance (for working-age adults) from £12,500 to £2,500 and the weekly National Insurance Primary Threshold from £184 to £50;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; these both reduce the amount of earnings one can receive before being taxed. The reform also treated the UBI as earned income for the purposes of means-tested benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result was progressive: poverty would fall by at least 17 percent, deep poverty (the population share with income below half the poverty threshold) by at least 50 percent, and inequality (as measured by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient&quot;&gt;Gini index&lt;/a&gt;) by at least 2.8 percent. However, even the least generous of the four UBI policies added over £20 billion to the deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(&quot;#graph_graph_verbal_tonight_1&quot;).load(&quot;/assets/markdown_assets/libdem-ubi-analysis/graph_verbal_tonight_1.html&quot;);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;graph_graph_verbal_tonight_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If made budget-neutral, this structure of pay-fors will fund a UBI of £42 per week. That policy would reduce poverty by 11%, deep poverty by 46%, and inequality by 2.4%, while leaving 39% of Britons better off and 47% worse off. For an apples-to-apples comparison, we consider this the baseline reform against which other adjustments are evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adjustments-to-the-working-groups-ubi-reform&quot;&gt;Adjustments to the working group’s UBI reform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We apply several modifications to the working group’s UBI reform that broaden the tax base (funding larger UBIs), broaden the recipient base, and change how the UBI is treated. Specifically, we model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Including children in the UBI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repealing the Personal Allowance and National Insurance Primary Threshold entirely&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Including pensioners in both the Personal Allowance reduction and the UBI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exempting the UBI from means-testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to modeling each of these changes individually, we consider applying all four changes together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these adjustments produces more progressive outcomes. The most important adjustment for achieving more progressive outcomes is including children, which lowers the weekly amount from £42 to £32: of all the adjustments we considered, this most reduces poverty, inequality, and the population share that comes out behind. Fully eliminating the Personal Allowance and Primary Threshold, which would raise the weekly amount from £42 to £55, produces the greatest reduction in deep poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most progressive approach is implementing all the adjustments. Fully eliminating the Personal Allowance and Primary Threshold for all workers would fund a £36 weekly payment to each person, without counting as income toward means-tested programs. This would reduce poverty by 40%—3.6 times as much as the plan in the discussion paper. It would also reduce deep poverty 20% more than the discussion paper, and reduce inequality 130% more. Critically for political viability, it is the only approach that benefits the majority of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lessons-align-with-other-simulations&quot;&gt;Lessons align with other simulations&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exploration shows that larger UBIs—both in generosity and inclusivity—deliver greater progressivity. The UBI Center’s US research findings mirror this lesson with respect to inclusivity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/why-some-low-income-people-come-out-behind-in-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend&quot;&gt;Excluding non-citizens was the primary reason Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend would leave some low-income people behind.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/child-ubi-share&quot;&gt;Including children in UBIs reduces poverty and inequality more.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/how-universal-basic-income-can-keep-poverty-from-rising-amid-covid19&quot;&gt;Including children and non-citizens makes for a more affordable Covid response.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.ubicenter.org/fpuc&quot;&gt;Universal transfers (especially including kids) reduce poverty and inequality more than extended unemployment benefits, which reach only a small share of the population.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/student-debt&quot;&gt;UBI is more progressive than student debt forgiveness, which is similarly exclusively targeted.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research on &lt;a href=&quot;/us-flat-tax&quot;&gt;flat income taxes&lt;/a&gt; also shows that more generous UBIs are more progressive, even when tax-funded, as does a comparison between our &lt;a href=&quot;/uk-blank-slate-ubi&quot;&gt;Blank Slate UBI model&lt;/a&gt; and more incremental reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, poverty, inequality, and how people fare compared to today are not the only factors to judge UBI policies on. Starting with a working age population could rhetorically fill a gap between Child Benefit and State Pension, and treating the UBI as income for means-testing can serve to reduce benefits’ scope without changing their structure. But as we showed in &lt;a href=&quot;/lib-dem-policy-paper&quot;&gt;yesterday’s analysis&lt;/a&gt;, the working group’s reforms didn’t change overall marginal tax rates substantially; true benefit reform may need to accompany the UBI policy to meaningfully improve work incentives and reduce bureaucratic burdens. So we’re left largely with the million Britons lifted out of poverty by a budget-neutral version of the working group’s UBI proposal, and the nearly three million more who’d be lifted out of poverty through a more expansive version of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the £45 per week UBI reform, the working group modeled lowering the Personal Allowance and Primary Threshold less than other reforms, to £4,000 and £50, respectively. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

      <updated>2021-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/uk-blank-slate-ubi</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/uk-blank-slate-ubi">&lt;h2 id=&quot;read-the-report-here&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/socialliberalforum/pages/3398/attachments/original/1620835589/SLF_UBI_Center_Report_FINAL.pdf?1620835589&quot;&gt;Read the report here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re thrilled to have launched our first report in the UK: &lt;a href=&quot;https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/socialliberalforum/pages/3398/attachments/original/1620835589/SLF_UBI_Center_Report_FINAL.pdf?1620835589&quot;&gt;“Blank Slate UBI: A Constructive Challenge for the UK Basic Income Debate.”&lt;/a&gt; The report, which we published with the UK’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.socialliberal.net/&quot;&gt;Social Liberal Forum&lt;/a&gt;, models three audacious budget-neutral UBI plans. These plans replace the existing tax and benefit system with a 50 percent flat income tax, which funds UBIs of between £60 and £221 per week, depending on age and policy design, including supplements for disability and region. As a result, poverty would fall by 32 percent or more, deep poverty by 86 percent, and the Gini inequality index by at least 8 percent; 58 percent of Britons would come out ahead on a net basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-05-13-uk-blank-slate-ubi/table.png&quot; alt=&quot;Summary statistics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is the UBI Center’s first simulation of UBI in the UK, and the first application of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PSLmodels/openfisca-uk/&quot;&gt;OpenFisca-UK&lt;/a&gt; open-source microsimulation model of the UK tax and benefit system, which the UBI Center developed with &lt;a href=&quot;http://openfisca.org&quot;&gt;OpenFisca&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pslmodels.org&quot;&gt;Policy Simulation Library&lt;/a&gt;. The report also demonstrates the first budget-neutral UK simulation to fund such generous UBI amounts—an average of £140 per week—and to reduce poverty to such a degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of the progressivity that can be achieved with this kind of wholesale reform, consider the effect by decile. Under each of the three reforms, the bottom decile benefits by at least 50 percent on average, while the upper three deciles lose 6-7 percent of their income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-05-13-uk-blank-slate-ubi/decile_pct.png&quot; alt=&quot;Average percent effect by decile&quot; title=&quot;Average percent effect by decile&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect is progressive not only on an average basis but also within deciles; for example, 92 percent of the bottom decile would see their incomes rise by at least 5 percent, compared to only 8 percent of the top decile with major gains (considering our reform with a disability supplement). We applied optimization algorithms to design the UBI policies as to minimize these losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-05-13-uk-blank-slate-ubi/within_decile_2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Distribution of effects by decile&quot; title=&quot;Distribution of effects by decile&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UBI discussion may be more advanced in the UK than in any country on Earth, and this launch marks only the beginning of our investment to contribute data and evidence to that discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my latest op-ed, I argue that cash assistance policies (the expanded Child Tax Credit and $1,400 checks) were some of the most popular and effective parts of the American Rescue Plan; that they would have been even better if closer to universal basic income; and that we should double down on those cash successes with a permanent child allowance and carbon dividend.

      <published>2021-04-03T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2021-04-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/california-ab65-calubi</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/california-ab65-calubi">&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the California Democratic Party &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/12/california-democratic-party-platform-supports-universal-basic-income.html&quot;&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; Universal Basic Income (UBI) to their party platform. Two years later, Assemblymember Evan Low (D-Campbell), who served as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebar.com/news/latest_news//286838&quot;&gt;national co-chair&lt;/a&gt; for Andrew Yang’s presidential campaign, introduced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2712&quot;&gt;UBI bill&lt;/a&gt; for California. In December 2020, Low reintroduced the bill for the 2020-21 legislative session, this time with Senator Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) as a coauthor and adding some minor revisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That bill, &lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB65&quot;&gt;AB65&lt;/a&gt;, establishes the CalUBI program to provide $1,000 per month to most California adults. We estimate that CalUBI would cut poverty by 83% while adding $282 billion to the annual state deficit. In this article, we provide more detail into these estimates and suggest paths toward feasible legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;californias-extreme-economy&quot;&gt;California’s extreme economy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California is both rich and poor. It ranks #8 among US states on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_GDP_per_capita&quot;&gt;GDP per capita&lt;/a&gt;, and #7 on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_income&quot;&gt;median household income&lt;/a&gt;. It also ranks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epi.org/multimedia/unequal-states-of-america/#/California&quot;&gt;#7 on income inequality&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and accordingly, its poverty rate is higher than its GDP would predict, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_poverty_rate#cite_note-9&quot;&gt;ranking #25&lt;/a&gt; based on the Official Poverty Measure (OPM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using the Supplemental Poverty Measure&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (SPM), however, California ranks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-272.pdf&quot;&gt;#1 on both overall poverty and child poverty&lt;/a&gt;: 17.2% of Californians are in poverty, compared to 12.5% of Americans. In fact, California has ranked #1 on SPM poverty every year since the Census Bureau first reported it by state in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2012/demo/p60-244.pdf&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because the SPM, unlike the OPM, adjusts for taxes, in-kind benefits (like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), and, most importantly for California, local housing costs. As a result of its housing shortage (California has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MaxGhenis/status/1187898060409466882&quot;&gt;fewest housing units per adult&lt;/a&gt; of any state), housing in California is notoriously expensive—&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/cost-of-living-index-by-state&quot;&gt;second only to Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California also stands out in terms of taxation.
Due to Prop 13 (1978), a ballot measure that limits property taxes, it ranks &lt;a href=&quot;https://wallethub.com/edu/states-with-the-highest-and-lowest-property-taxes/11585&quot;&gt;#35 on local property taxes&lt;/a&gt;.
The state offsets that revenue loss with high income taxes—its &lt;a href=&quot;https://taxfoundation.org/publications/state-individual-income-tax-rates-and-brackets/&quot;&gt;top marginal rate is 13.3%&lt;/a&gt;, the highest of any state—and high sales taxes—its &lt;a href=&quot;https://taxfoundation.org/2020-sales-taxes/&quot;&gt;state rate is 7.25%&lt;/a&gt;, the highest of any state, and its state and local combined rate ranks #9. It is among the 41 states that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbpp.org/research/state-budget-and-tax/state-taxes-on-capital-gains&quot;&gt;tax capital gains as ordinary income&lt;/a&gt;, which raises significant revenue given its residents claim 8.1% of their income in capital gains, a higher share than all but three states. The net result is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://taxfoundation.org/publications/state-local-tax-burden-rankings/&quot;&gt;state and local tax burden of 11.5%&lt;/a&gt;, ranking #8 across states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state deploys these higher-than-average tax revenues for generous transfers. It matches the federal Earned Income Tax Credit at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/state-earned-income-tax-credits&quot;&gt;85% for low income workers&lt;/a&gt;, a higher rate than any other state, and adds a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/personal/credits/california-earned-income-tax-credit.html&quot;&gt;Young Child Tax Credit&lt;/a&gt; supplement for qualifying families with children under age 6. Due to generously funding the Aid to Dependent Families Children (cash welfare) matching grant in the 1990s, California today gets &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niskanencenter.org/inequitable-and-inadequate-reforming-federal-grants-for-state-social-assistance-programs/&quot;&gt;more per child&lt;/a&gt; from its replacement, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), than all states but New York and Vermont. And while California has &lt;a href=&quot;https://ca.db101.org/ca/programs/income_support/calworks/program2.htm&quot;&gt;not yet eliminated asset limits for TANF&lt;/a&gt;, it is among the 33 states to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/snaps-broad-based-categorical-eligibility-supports-working-families-and&quot;&gt;raised income and asset limits for SNAP&lt;/a&gt;. It &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/&quot;&gt;expanded Medicaid&lt;/a&gt; as quickly as it could following the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and overall spends more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/state-and-local-general-expenditures-capita&quot;&gt;per capita on public welfare&lt;/a&gt; than 43 states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lack of welfare spending doesn’t explain California’s highest-in-the-nation poverty rate, but more inclusive and generous welfare programs can nonetheless ameliorate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-impact-of-ab65&quot;&gt;The impact of AB65&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AB65 creates the CalUBI program, which provides $1,000 per month to Californians meeting these eligibility conditions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(A) Is a resident, and has been a resident for the three most recent consecutive taxable years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(B) Is at least 18 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(C) Is not currently incarcerated in a county jail or the state prison.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(D) Reported gross income that does not exceed 200 percent of the median per capita income for the eligible recipient’s current county of residence, as determined by the United States Census Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AB65 also levies a 1% tax on incomes above $2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using data from the 2017-2019 Current Population Survey March Supplements, we estimate that 58% of Californians would be eligible for CalUBI. 77% meet the age requirement, 83% meet the income requirement,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 97% meet the migration requirement,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and 99.5% meet the incarceration requirement.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Providing the $12,000 payment to each of the 23.6 million eligible recipients would cost $283 billion per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enacting the policy would reduce poverty by 83%, to 3.0%; for context, Minnesota currently has the lowest poverty rate, at 6.5%. It would also reduce inequality by 26%.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; For these calculations, we assume that the CalUBI would not be counted as income for tax liabilities or benefit eligibility, though this may be unrealistic: Alaska’s Permanent Fund Dividend does not affect eligibility for programs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ak.db101.org/ak/programs/income_support/ssi/faqs.htm#_q7329&quot;&gt;Supplemental Security Income&lt;/a&gt;, but the payments are &lt;a href=&quot;https://pfd.alaska.gov/Payments/Tax-Information#:~:text=Even%20if%20part%20or%20all,Permanent%20Fund%20Dividend%20is%20%24992.00.&quot;&gt;subject&lt;/a&gt; to federal income tax (Alaska has &lt;a href=&quot;http://tax.alaska.gov/programs/programs/index.aspx?10001&quot;&gt;no state income tax&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the program lacks funding. Using the Policy Simulation Library’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.compute.studio/PSLmodels/Tax-Brain/&quot;&gt;TaxBrain&lt;/a&gt; tool and the IRS Public Use File, we estimate that a 1% tax on incomes above $2 million would raise &lt;a href=&quot;https://compute.studio/PSLmodels/Tax-Brain/50389/&quot;&gt;$2.33 billion federally&lt;/a&gt;. Scaling that down to California by its share of personal income in excess of $100,000&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; yields a revenue estimate of $340 million, or 0.1% of CalUBI’s cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;perverse-incentives-from-means-testing&quot;&gt;Perverse incentives from means-testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CalUBI means-testing approach creates perverse incentives in two ways: its immediate benefit cliff discourages people from working, and its geographic cliff discourages people from residing in lower-income counties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, consider a single resident of Santa Clara County earning $100,000 per year, let’s call them Alex. Santa Clara County is home to Google, Apple, San Jose, and Assemblymember Evan Low, and its median personal income is about $53,500, second only to San Francisco County ($55,000) in California. With income below twice the median, Alex would be eligible for CalUBI. Their net income would be $100,000 minus $28,743 in federal, FICA, and state income taxes,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; plus $12,000 in CalUBI, totaling $83,257.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now suppose Alex is offered a job that pays 10% more. At $110,000 income, they exceed the $107,000 CalUBI threshold for Santa Clara County, so they no longer receive the $12,000 payment. As a result of their raise, Alex’s net income &lt;em&gt;falls 7%&lt;/em&gt; from $83,257 to $77,162. To get back to their original net income, they’d have to earn more than $120,000; if Alex can’t get at least a 20% raise, they’re better off with their current income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose that instead of taking a new higher-paying job in Santa Clara County, Alex considers moving to neighboring Santa Cruz County for a job paying the same $100,000. Where the median income in Santa Clara County is over $53,000, it’s under $33,000 in Santa Cruz County. Alex would lose CalUBI eligibility, and their net income would therefore fall $12,000—a full 14%—if they were to cross the county border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These welfare cliffs and discontinuities harmfully distort behavior. People like Alex will avoid earning too much money, or perhaps they’ll favor a job with deferred compensation plans to lower their income, or they’ll defer capital gains themselves, all to stay under the threshold in their county. They’ll also avoid moving to lower-income areas, maybe choosing to commute from a more expensive area instead to retain CalUBI eligibility. This would increase geographic inequalities by raising high-income people’s demand to live in high-income areas. Just as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094119011000520&quot;&gt;school district boundaries determine housing prices&lt;/a&gt;, county boundaries would do the same under this policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;universal-designs&quot;&gt;Universal designs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AB65’s cliff could be mitigated by phasing the benefit out with income, as programs like SNAP and the Earned Income Tax Credit do, and as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax&quot;&gt;negative income tax&lt;/a&gt; cousin of UBI does. Depending on the design, this could avoid Alex’s quagmire and ensure that any additional dollar they earn raises their net income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this phase-out would be a hidden tax: if the benefit phases out at 50 cents per dollar of earnings, that’s equivalent to a 50% marginal tax, on top of normal taxes and phase-outs of other benefits. The array of means-tested benefits explains why parents around the poverty line currently face &lt;a href=&quot;https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/aspe-files/260661/brief2-overviewmtranalyses.pdf&quot;&gt;higher marginal tax rates&lt;/a&gt; than any other group in the country, often exceeding 50% and sometimes exceeding 100%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, if the benefit is means-tested but distributed monthly, recipients would be required to report changes to their income regularly. This costs recipients of existing benefits time and explains some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbpp.org/research/romneys-charge-that-most-federal-low-income-spending-goes-for-overhead-and-bureaucrats-is&quot;&gt;high administrative overhead costs&lt;/a&gt;. To support income reporting requirements for the American Rescue Plan’s monthly Child Tax Credit expansion, the IRS is building a portal, an endeavor that’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://abc11.com/child-tax-credit-irs-stimulus-delay/10432494/&quot;&gt;slowing the delivery&lt;/a&gt; of funds to low and middle income parents. The alternative is how refundable tax credits work today: calculated from income often a year or more in the past, without the ability to meet real-time needs, especially when financial circumstances change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other AB65 targeting provisions have drawbacks, too. County-level income thresholds will induce migration even with phase-outs. A three-year residency requirement conflicts with Californians’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-01/skelton-ppic-poll-immigration-healthcare-california&quot;&gt;pro-immigration sentiment&lt;/a&gt; (the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend only has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pfd.alaska.gov/Eligibility/Requirements&quot;&gt;one-year requirement&lt;/a&gt;). And as our other research shows, excluding children misses an opportunity to &lt;a href=&quot;https://child-allowance.ubicenter.org/empirical.html&quot;&gt;improve lifelong development&lt;/a&gt;, and to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ubicenter.org/20210120/child-ubi-share.html&quot;&gt;cost-effectively reduce poverty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universality bypasses all of these issues. Universal payments don’t discourage work through hidden taxes or cliffs; they don’t require recipients to report income more than once per tax year; they can be efficiently distributed; they demonstrate inclusiveness toward newcomers; and they provide kids the resources they need to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, universality is more expensive. Expanding CalUBI to each person in California would raise the cost from $283 billion to $472 billion—a sixth of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CARGSP&quot;&gt;state’s GDP&lt;/a&gt; and more than twice the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/01/08/governor-newsom-proposes-2021-22-state-budget&quot;&gt;current state budget&lt;/a&gt;. If funds could be conjured to pay for it, it would drive down the poverty rate to 1.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But given a fixed budget, poverty is often minimized by spreading it across more of the population in smaller amounts. Spreading the $283 billion across each person in California would give each about $590 per month, and this would have virtually the same antipoverty impact as the original proposal.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That is, excluding children and newcomers offsets the progressivity of excluding higher-income people (not to mention the distortions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the $283 billion price tag makes AB65 unworkable as written. What policies could make progress toward its goals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-california-child-allowance&quot;&gt;A California child allowance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monthly cash transfers can efficiently relieve poverty and reduce inequality at the state level, but given to everyone, they’re costly. Even a $100 monthly UBI would cost California $48 billion per year, more than a fifth of the current state budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A focus on children could be a tenable, effective starting point. Given &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/CA&quot;&gt;9 million&lt;/a&gt; of California’s 40 million residents are under 18, a $100 monthly child allowance (cash payments given to parents for each child) would cost $11 billion annually. That’s 0.4% of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CARGSP&quot;&gt;California’s $2.9 trillion GDP&lt;/a&gt; or 5% of its proposed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2021-22/pdf/BudgetSummary/SummaryCharts.pdf&quot;&gt;$227 billion budget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://child-allowance.ubicenter.org/simulation.html&quot;&gt;child allowance simulation&lt;/a&gt; shows that this would be achievable and impactful in California. The state could fund a $100 monthly child allowance with a 1% income tax, cutting child poverty by 16%, adult poverty by 5%, and overall poverty by 7%. The bottom decile of Californians would see incomes rise by 11%, and on average only the upper three deciles would lose income, and only by under 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/2021-04-03-california-ab65-calubi/deciles_100_child_allowance.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of revenue options could fund such a program:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding to the income tax, as described in the above simulation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Applying California’s expected &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/gavin-newsom-california-coronavirus-pandemic-8d01e88ceeb4b0bc6cb1fb0d6a8d72b7&quot;&gt;$15 billion surplus&lt;/a&gt; in 2021. This wouldn’t fund a permanent policy, but could fund a $100 monthly child allowance, plus a $100 monthly young child supplement, for a trial year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxing commercial property at market value would raise between &lt;a href=&quot;https://lao.ca.gov/BallotAnalysis/Proposition?number=15&amp;amp;year=2020#:~:text=The%20measure%20requires%20commercial%20and,over%20time%20starting%20in%202022.&quot;&gt;$6.5 and $11.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; per year. A ballot measure to do this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-10/proposition-15-commercial-property-tax-defeated&quot;&gt;narrowly lost&lt;/a&gt; in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ending the mortgage interest deduction on second homes would raise $250 million per year. &lt;a href=&quot;https://a25.asmdc.org/press-releases/20210219-assemblymember-alex-lee-introduces-repeal-regressive-mortgage-interest&quot;&gt;AB946&lt;/a&gt; proposes to do this, though the revenue is used for a first-time home buyer program.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conforming parts of the state income tax code with federal tax code changes enacted as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; this would raise &lt;a href=&quot;https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3959&quot;&gt;$1.7 billion&lt;/a&gt; per year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replacing other benefit programs, such as CalWORKS (the state TANF program), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), the child component of CalEITC, and the Young Child Tax Credit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instituting an estate tax, as was &lt;a href=&quot;https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/20190326-senator-wiener-introduces-california-estate-tax-proposal-fund-programs-reducing-wealth&quot;&gt;proposed in 2017&lt;/a&gt; and which was estimated to raise between $500 million and $1 billion per year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repealing other state tax deductions that primarily benefit high income households, such as the property tax deduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;or-a-california-young-child-allowance&quot;&gt;Or a California young child allowance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For greater affordability, California could focus on the group whose development is most sensitive to financial conditions, and whose needs are most costly due to childcare: young kids. Providing a young child allowance of $100 per month to each of California’s 3 million Californians children under age 6 would cost $4 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington and Sacramento have both already prioritized the needs of young kids: the American Rescue Plan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/03/11/new-child-tax-credit-could-slash-poverty-now-and-boost-social-mobility-later/&quot;&gt;Child Tax Credit expansion&lt;/a&gt; provides an extra $50 per month to children under age 6 compared to older kids, and California provides a Young Child Tax Credit (YCTC) of up to $1,000 per year to families who qualify for the federal Earned Income Tax Credit and have at least one child under age 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transforming the YCTC into a young child allowance of $100 per month per child would have several benefits, by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Including families with no earned income who are ineligible for EITC&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Providing more money for families with multiple young children&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoiding adding a 20% marginal tax to qualifying families with income between the phase-out region of $25,000 and $30,000&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Including children whose parents earn above $30,000&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enhancing the benefit by at least $200 per year for all current recipients&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meeting needs on a monthly basis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Potentially sending parents money proactively, rather than relying on families filing tax returns (many of whom don’t have to file since they don’t owe taxes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;california-can-make-policy-progress-toward-ubi&quot;&gt;California can make policy progress toward UBI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California is in many ways the center of the UBI conversation. Its tech community has long promoted the idea as an insurance policy against technological unemployment, supporting Andrew Yang’s candidacy, funding basic income pilots, and donating to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/basic-income/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly’s basic income experiment&lt;/a&gt; in Kenya. Of the 40 mayors in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayorsforagi.org/&quot;&gt;Mayors for a Guaranteed Income&lt;/a&gt; network, 6 lead California cities, including its founder, Michael Tubbs. The pilot in Tubbs’s hometown of Stockton was one of the first of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://basicincome.stanford.edu/experiments-map/&quot;&gt;wave&lt;/a&gt; that now includes Compton, Long Beach, Oakland, Marin County, and San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pilots may provide more precise estimates of how people respond to guaranteed income, but we already know from a slew of studies that cash transfers &lt;a href=&quot;https://child-allowance.ubicenter.org/empirical.html&quot;&gt;improve health, well-being, and educational outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, and that they &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/remahanna/files/151016_labor_supply_paper_draft_final.pdf&quot;&gt;don’t reduce labor supply much&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/do-poor-waste-transfers-booze-and-cigarettes-no&quot;&gt;raise spending on vices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In introducing AB65, Assemblymember Low has started the next phase of California’s UBI conversation. The idea is ready for policy implementation, but if it’s to be more than signaling, it will need to fit in a budget the governor can sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Rodelo provided research assistance for this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;California has the 7th highest ratio of top 1% to bottom 99% income: 30.7, compared to 26.3 nationwide. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Poverty researchers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2015/9/16/9337041/supplemental-poverty-measure&quot;&gt;generally prefer the SPM&lt;/a&gt; over the OPM, and that’s what the UBI Center uses in its analysis. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We interpreted a county’s “median per capita income” as the median personal income among people with income greater than zero. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Current Population Survey only includes migration data from one year ago. 1.0% of Californians lived in a different state one year ago. To approximate the three-year requirement, we tripled the observation weights for this 1%; this also served to “age” the data from the 2017-2019 period to 2021, as it produces a total population estimate of 40.1 million. The University of Virginia Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service &lt;a href=&quot;https://demographics.coopercenter.org/united-states-interactive-map&quot;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; that California’s 2020 population was 40.4 million. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/technical-documentation/methodology.html&quot;&gt;Current Population Survey omits prisoners&lt;/a&gt;, so we used data from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/CA.html&quot;&gt;Prison Policy Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, which estimates that 213,000 Californians were in state prison or county jail as of 2018. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We measure inequality as the Gini index of the ratio between a person’s poverty unit’s (similar to a household) resources and its poverty threshold. The current value is 0.42, and under CalUBI it would fall to 0.31. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.internationalwomensday.com/&quot;&gt;International Women’s Day&lt;/a&gt; asks its celebrants to challenge the world in order to change it (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ChooseToChallenge&quot;&gt;#ChooseToChallenge&lt;/a&gt;).
The following simulation seeks to challenge the fact that women in the United States are more likely to be impoverished than men.
In our analysis, we evaluate a Universal Basic Income (UBI), funded by a flat income tax, as a possible solution for both alleviating poverty and narrowing the gendered poverty gap.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:modeling&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:modeling&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poverty rates for children are roughly equal between genders, while adult women experience poverty at rates 17 percent greater than adult men: 12.4 percent vs. 10.6 percent.
As a general trend, the difference in poverty rates between women and men increases with age.
For example, 20.8 percent of women aged 85 or older are in poverty, compared to only 14.5 percent of men of the same age.
Among people aged 85 or older, women experience deep poverty at twice the rate of men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a significant difference in rates of poverty for adult women as compared to men, how might a UBI help close that gap?
Our past modeling has shown that a UBI would lessen poverty across demographic groups, and also shrink poverty disparities by &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ubicenter.org/20210118/racial-poverty-disparities-mlk-day-2021.html&quot;&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ubicenter.org/20201012/indigenous.html&quot;&gt;Indigenous heritage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ubicenter.org/20200731/ada30.html&quot;&gt;disability status&lt;/a&gt;.
Our research here shows that it would do the same by gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After receiving a UBI, the poverty rates for women and men converge as the monthly amount increases (we’ve focused on adults here).
Consistent with our past simulations, a $300 monthly UBI would halve the rate of female poverty and female deep poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBI significantly narrows the ratio of poverty and deep poverty rates for adult women compared to adult men.
With a monthly UBI of $500, the rate of women compared to men in poverty is more than halved and the rate of women compared to men in deep poverty is nearly equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gender income gap is inseparable from the issue of care work.
On one hand, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2018/2/19/17018380/gender-wage-gap-childcare-penalty&quot;&gt;“baby penalty”&lt;/a&gt; explains much of the gap, with mothers earning less than fathers while women and men without children have similar earnings.
Meanwhile, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/aspe-files/260661/brief2-overviewmtranalyses.pdf&quot;&gt;high marginal tax rates&lt;/a&gt; for low-income parents (due to the phasing out of benefits) discourages work disproportionately of mothers.
A &lt;a href=&quot;https://americancompass.org/essays/home-building-survey-part-2/&quot;&gt;recent poll&lt;/a&gt; found that Americans prefer cash assistance to other family assistance policies like paid family leave, subsidized childcare, wage subsidies, and baby bonds.
Mothers, fathers, and low-income people especially preferred cash assistance, which would likely be more distributionally progressive than other policy options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her &lt;a href=&quot;https://almazzelleke.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/zelleke-institutionalizing-the-universal-caretaker-dec-2008.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; advocating for UBI as compared to other alternatives, political scientist Almaz Zelleke states that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly for advocates of gender equality, a basic income by virtue of its universality goes to both providers and recipients of care, and thus has the best chance of eliminating poverty for the most vulnerable group in contemporary capitalist economies: single mothers and their children. To any feminist, this should be a strong argument in favor of basic income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women provide most of the care work that today goes unpaid and unrecognized.
UBI compensates for that care work, reducing gender inequities and investing in the well-being of the cared-for.
Our analysis suggests that a UBI could be a relevant policy in the greater movement for the social, economic, and political equality of women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The large racial wealth gap traces its roots to slavery, redlining, and other discriminatory policies, and persists largely due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-21/how-income-inequality-feeds-the-racial-wealth-gap&quot;&gt;racial income gaps&lt;/a&gt;.
In honor of Black History month, we explore how closing part of this income gap with a universal basic income would affect the racial wealth gap, using novel measurements that consider how Black and White families differ across the full wealth distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two most common measures of the racial wealth gap simply compare mean and median wealth between White and Black families.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:head&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:head&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
Based on the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:scf&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:scf&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, White families have mean wealth 5.7 times that of Black families, and median wealth 6.4 times that of Black families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the median tells us where the middle of the distributions lay, it can obscure what is going on throughout the rest of the distribution.
To visualize a variable’s distribution in full, we can turn to the cumulative distribution function (CDF), which shows the population share with less than a specified value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following graph shows how to interpret a CDF graph of of wealth per adult for all families in the U.S. (Note that while we have logarithmically transformed the x-axis, the y-axis remains linear.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how can we compare the distributions of wealth between Black and White families?
The two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical test offers a way to test the difference between two distributions.
The KS statistic, or D-statistic (for “distance”), is the maximum absolute vertical distance between two CDFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One advantage to this statistical method is that it is quite simple to explain visually.
The below chart plots the CDF for White and Black families.
The dotted line drawn between the two curves shows where the vertical distance between them is at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows us that approximately 65.9% of Black families have a wealth of less than $50,000 per adult, whereas only 33.3% of White families fall below that line.
As we will see, the threshold can be at any point along these curves; the KS statistic is the value measuring the size of the gap where the gap is the largest, at 0.326 (the actual wealth value corresponding to the D-statistic was $50,888).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following model, we simulate how saving a total of one year’s UBI payments could change the racial wealth gap. We apply a flat tax on all income to fund the UBI program, and subtract each family’s new tax payment from their wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the bottom graph, you can see the vertical distance between the two curves at each point along the x-axis from $0 to $2,000 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is notable that while the KS D-statistics declines overall, it fluctuates until we get to $500 payments, at which point the D-statistic begins a steady decline to minimum of 0.300 under the $2,000 monthly benefit scenario.
This is because the distances between the two curves are much larger around the center of the distributions than around the tails, thus the changes in the KS test are not picking up changes at lower incomes, where the curves were much closer together to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our simulations, the wealth point at which the curves are furthest apart increases with the UBI amount.
The wealth at which the gap is the biggest rises to just above $121,000, from $50,000 at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The median wealth for White families rises from $115,103 without a UBI to $119,425 under a $1,000 monthly payment, and rises to $127,505 with a $2,000 monthly payment.
For Black families, a $1,000 UBI nearly doubles the median wealth, from $17,853 to $34,183, and a $2,000 monthly benefit grows it further to $48,310.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the median wealth per adult&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:peradult&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:peradult&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; rises among White families, it merely rises by less than that of Black families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the scenarios we explore, the outcomes for Black families improve in the share of families with wealth per adult below $50,000 declines, median family wealth increases.
In the final plot below, you can explore the relative changes in all of the metrics we’ve chosen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;asset10&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these metrics aren’t truly comparable, we can see that the KS statistic is more stubborn than other measures, especially the gap in median wealth.
Median Black wealth is so low that even modest redistribution can close that gap quickly, but larger gaps in the middle of the distribution will persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will continue this line of research, especially longer-term dynamic analysis to reflect the accumulative nature of wealth.
Our simplifying assumption that the entire tax and transfer system flows straight to wealth, rather than consumption, may exaggerate these trends given propensities to consume decrease with wealth. But recurring redistribution would likely have a significantly larger effect in closing the gap, even accounting for consumption.
UBI isn’t the only policy that can reduce racial wealth disparities, but it certainly helps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <published>2021-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2021-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/family-security-act</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/family-security-act">&lt;p&gt;On February 4, Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) introduced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.romney.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2021-02/family%20security%20act_one%20pager.pdf&quot;&gt;Family Security Act&lt;/a&gt;, a monthly child allowance funded by replacing redundant programs and ending regressive tax expenditures. While it phases out at high incomes and caps the total benefit amount for large families, the policy is the most generous of the major proposals put forward and comes closest to a universal child allowance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Family Security Act (FSA) would significantly reduce poverty, and especially deep child poverty. As a budget-neutral policy, it could be made permanent through budget reconciliation, which requires only 50 votes in the Senate. And because the payments go to all parents, with high-income parents repaying it when filing taxes, it doesn’t require special mechanisms to target parents on income when sending checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the FSA does:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pays parents $350 per month per child under age 6 and $250 per month for children age 6 to 17, with a maximum total benefit of $1,250 per month, through the Social Security Administration (SSA)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taxes parents at 5 percent of each dollar of child allowances for singles with income above $200,000 and couples with income above $400,000, at tax time through the IRS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeals the existing Child Tax Credit (CTC), which maxes out at $2,000 per child per year but excludes the poorest children through its phase-in design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replaces the current Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which largely benefits families with children, with a per-worker wage subsidy of up to $1,000 per worker&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeals the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) federal block grant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeals the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC), which provides up to $3,000 per child or dependent, but excludes poor families&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeals the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeals the Head of Household (HoH) filing status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While that’s a substantial array of reforms, it would dramatically reduce the complexity of the US tax and benefit system. Nobody’s yet conducted a full distributional analysis of all the components together, &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but both the child benefit replacements and the tax reforms are independently very progressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-child-allowance-is-mostly-funded-by-repealing-existing-programs-and-the-salt-deduction&quot;&gt;The child allowance is mostly funded by repealing existing programs and the SALT deduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Niskanen Center, which helped craft the policy, the two new programs introduced by the Family Security Act would cost $254 billion: $229.5 billion for the child allowance and $24.5 billion for the worker credit. The largest cost offsets are the programs they directly replace: the $117 billion CTC and the $71 billion EITC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;759&quot; height=&quot;470&quot; seamless=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRurbf8SIZ9FNptyJt4TpeSoXfHbWJnqhja89b4XhHAewtnDEVnYQzwb1rdorwqzzEf8WPGI1GPK1PL/pubchart?oid=1916198415&amp;amp;format=interactive&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other largest cost offset is SALT repeal ($25.2 billion). After that, TANF repeal ($16.5 billion), HoH repeal ($16.5 billion), CDCTC repeal ($4.7 billion), and SNAP categorical eligibility changes ($3.1 billion from people who no longer automatically qualify for SNAP through TANF) round out the program’s budget neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-family-security-act-cuts-deep-child-poverty-in-half&quot;&gt;The Family Security Act cuts deep child poverty in half&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Niskanen Center &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Analysis-of-the-Romney-Child-Allowance_final.pdf&quot;&gt;estimated the poverty impact&lt;/a&gt; of this reform by simulating the primary components that would affect people in poverty (all but SALT, CDCTC, and the minor categorical eligibility changes to SNAP). They found that the FSA would cut child poverty by a third, cut deep child poverty (below half the poverty line) by half, and cut adult and overall poverty by 8 and 14 percent, respectively.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;371&quot; seamless=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRurbf8SIZ9FNptyJt4TpeSoXfHbWJnqhja89b4XhHAewtnDEVnYQzwb1rdorwqzzEf8WPGI1GPK1PL/pubchart?oid=1618008061&amp;amp;format=interactive&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What explains such large antipoverty effects? Chiefly, filling in the CTC’s exclusion of the poorest children. This exclusion is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-child-tax-credit&quot;&gt;by design&lt;/a&gt;, since only part of the credit is refundable (i.e., benefits families who don’t owe taxes), and the refundable part phases in with income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/styles/original_optimized/public/book_images/3.4.1.1.png?itok=Vba42ckx&quot; alt=&quot;Child Tax Credit schedule&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EITC also excludes the poorest children via a similar phase-in structure. It primarily goes to families with children, providing at most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/earned-income-and-earned-income-tax-credit-eitc-tables#EITC%20Tables&quot;&gt;$543 to childless workers&lt;/a&gt;. Even with these designs, the antipoverty effects of refundable tax credits like the EITC and CTC are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2020/05/18/the-myths-of-the-earned-income-tax-credit/&quot;&gt;typically overstated&lt;/a&gt; because they neglect that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eitc.irs.gov/eitc-central/statistics-for-tax-returns-with-eitc/statistics-for-tax-returns-with-eitc&quot;&gt;one in five&lt;/a&gt; eligible families fails to claim them, often due to complex application processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal TANF funding has been fixed at $16.5 billion since it replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in 1996. Unlike AFDC, which was a federal cash assistance program, TANF is a block grant that provides states wide latitude on how to distribute the funds. In 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbpp.org/research/family-income-support/to-lessen-hardship-states-should-invest-more-tanf-dollars-in-basic&quot;&gt;21 percent&lt;/a&gt; of total (federal plus state) TANF dollars provided cash assistance, and 9 percent provided refundable tax credits like state-level EITCs. The remaining 70 percent funded work programs, programs for children, more exotic programs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketplace.org/2016/05/31/twenty-years-after-welfare-reform-how-are-states-spending-funds/&quot;&gt;marriage counseling&lt;/a&gt;, and abuses like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2020/05/04/ms-welfare-scandal-audit-94-m-questionable-spending/3076949001/&quot;&gt;speeches from football stars&lt;/a&gt;. And because the block grant is a matching fund, federal funding varies considerably by state, flowing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niskanencenter.org/inequitable-and-inadequate-reforming-federal-grants-for-state-social-assistance-programs/&quot;&gt;disproportionately to richer states&lt;/a&gt;: in 2019, New York got the most at $604 per child, while Nevada got the least at $63 per child. Finally, TANF cash assistance carries lifetime limits and work requirements that keep it out of reach from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbpp.org/research/family-income-support/cash-assistance-should-reach-millions-more-families-to-lessen&quot;&gt;77 percent of poor families&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike tax credits and work-oriented low-cash welfare programs, universal child allowances are designed to reach all poor children, and the Social Security Administration’s expertise in cash transfers would likely turn that design into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tax-reforms-make-the-policy-even-more-progressive&quot;&gt;Tax reforms make the policy even more progressive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Family Security Act’s funding can be divided into welfare programs—EITC, CTC, and TANF—and tax reforms—SALT, HoH, and CDCTC. The policy’s poverty reduction indicates that the welfare component is progressive, and the tax reforms meet the remaining revenue needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trio of tax reforms is highly progressive; that is, they reduce the after-tax income of rich people more than poor people. The bottom third of taxpayers would experience virtually no income loss, and the impact mostly rises with income. The 8th decile is most affected, losing an average of 0.6 percent of after-tax income from the tax reforms (the child allowance would offset this for many). SALT repeal is the most progressive component, and the largest; HoH and CDCTC repeal are also progressive on their own, but less than SALT.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;695&quot; height=&quot;442&quot; seamless=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRurbf8SIZ9FNptyJt4TpeSoXfHbWJnqhja89b4XhHAewtnDEVnYQzwb1rdorwqzzEf8WPGI1GPK1PL/pubchart?oid=1136237369&amp;amp;format=interactive&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Repealing these policies would simplify the tax system and align it with that of other countries. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/30/16557554/the-state-and-local-tax-deduction-explained&quot;&gt;SALT deductions&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Analysis-of-the-Romney-Child-Allowance_final.pdf&quot;&gt;head of household filing status&lt;/a&gt; are both rare among countries like the US. Removing the head of household status, which is available to parents who pay most of the costs of maintaining a household while living with a child for most of a calendar year, would cut the filing statuses from four to three and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/54789&quot;&gt;reduce verification burdens on the IRS&lt;/a&gt;. And child allowances make nonrefundable tax credits like the CDCTC obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-policy-would-probably-reduce-labor-supply-a-bit&quot;&gt;The policy would probably reduce labor supply a bit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy reforms generally affect labor supply in two ways: the &lt;em&gt;income effect&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;substitution effect&lt;/em&gt;. The income effect describes how people work less when they have more net income; this is welfare-enhancing as they trade work for leisure. The substitution effect describes how people work less when they benefit less from that work due to higher marginal tax rates; this is welfare-reducing since they would prefer to have the income from working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Universal basic incomes, and similarly structured programs like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pfd.alaska.gov/&quot;&gt;Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend&lt;/a&gt;, reduce labor supply through the income effect only. Negative income taxes, a form of guaranteed income that provides a minimum guarantee and then phases out steadily with earnings, reduce labor supply through both the income effect and the substitution effect, since the phase-out is equivalent to a higher marginal tax rate. _Trapezoid _programs, which phase in with income, pay a certain maximum amount, and then phase out with income, increase labor supply in the phase-in region via the substitution effect, reduce labor supply throughout via the income effect, and decrease labor supply in the phase-out region via the substitution effect. Trapezoids can be explicit, like the CTC and EITC, or more implicit, like the CDCTC (which effectively phases in because it’s not refundable) or TANF (which carries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbpp.org/research/family-income-support/temporary-assistance-for-needy-families&quot;&gt;work requirements&lt;/a&gt; that create a de facto discontinuous phase-in, though these can also be fulfilled by uncompensated work-seeking or training programs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies show that substitution effects outweigh income effects. To compare the effects, we can express them quantitatively as &lt;em&gt;elasticities&lt;/em&gt;; that is, the percent change in hours worked with respect to a one-percent change in the underlying factor. That factor is the after-tax marginal wage rate for the substitution effect, and the after-tax average wage rate for the income effect. Reviewing the empirical literature, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/43674-laborsupplyfiscalpolicy.pdf&quot;&gt;Congressional Budget Office&lt;/a&gt; estimates that the substitution elasticity is 0.25 for primary earners (a one-percent change to the after-tax marginal wage increases hours worked by 0.25 percent), and estimates that the income elasticity is -0.05 (a one-percent change to the after-tax average wage rate reduces hours worked by 0.05 percent). They also find that substitution effects are stronger among poorer earners and secondary earners, and that income effects are fairly consistent across earner types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Components of the Family Security Act create both positive and negative income effects, and positive and negative substitution effects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By itself, the new child allowance reduces labor supply through the income effect, and also through the substitution effect for high earners.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repealing the trapezoids—CTC, CDCTC, the child component of the EITC, and TANF—has various effects depending on income, as described above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expanding the EITC for childless workers into an earner credit will also have various effects depending on income, as another trapezoid.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repealing SALT and HoH reduces labor supply through the substitution effect and increases labor supply through the income effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In lieu of a comprehensive analysis of how the full reform affects marginal and effective tax rates, we can consider where each effect will be strongest. The largest substitution effects are probably the loss of CTC phase-ins and the higher taxes from SALT repeal, both of which will reduce labor supply (though removing TANF’s severe phase-outs, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://ca.db101.org/ca/programs/income_support/calworks/program2b.htm&quot;&gt;50 percent in California&lt;/a&gt;, will also increase labor supply). Income effects are weaker, and by their nature tend to balance out in budget-neutral reforms, though they may be higher for low-income people since the child allowance will raise their incomes relatively more. In combination, the bill would probably modestly reduce labor supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25246/a-roadmap-to-reducing-child-poverty&quot;&gt;2019 report&lt;/a&gt; from the National Academies of Science modeled replacing the CTC with a $250 monthly child allowance, phasing out between 300 and 400 percent of the poverty line. Assuming larger income elasticities than the CBO, they found that earnings would fall by $3.9 billion, lowering the antipoverty impact by two percent (from cutting child poverty by 42 percent to cutting it by 41 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When parents respond to child allowances by working less, they do so in part to care for their children. Evidence suggests that this time spent between parents and their children is beneficial: cash assistance for families &lt;a href=&quot;https://child-allowance.ubicenter.org/empirical.html&quot;&gt;consistently improves child outcomes&lt;/a&gt; like health, development, education, and lifelong outcomes, while childcare subsidies have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w21571&quot;&gt;mixed effects&lt;/a&gt; on children while &lt;a href=&quot;https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/effects-ccdf-subsidy-program-employment-outcomes-low-income-mothers&quot;&gt;increasing maternal labor supply&lt;/a&gt;. It also saves parents childcare costs, a factor neither the NAS report nor other such reports have quantified when assessing the labor supply effect on poverty reduction.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Analysis of welfare programs should include estimates on parental labor supply, but this line of inquiry also requires the context that economic datasets exclude home childcare by parents as a type of labor supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-improve-the-family-security-act&quot;&gt;How to improve the Family Security Act&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FSA offers key benefits absent from other child benefit proposals. House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal (D-MA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://waysandmeans.house.gov/sites/democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/files/documents/7.%20Tax_sxs.pdf&quot;&gt;proposed in February&lt;/a&gt; expanding the CTC for one year and making it pay out monthly. Because the Neal proposal is unfunded, it cannot be made permanent law through budget reconciliation as the FSA can. It also pays out $50 less per month to young children, and doesn’t expand the EITC for childless workers. It phases out at lower incomes than the FSA, and sends targeted checks through the IRS based on a taxpayer’s income in the prior year, offering them a web portal to report income or family changes that would affect amounts and avoid surprise bills the next year. The Neal plan also does not make the tax code more progressive at the upper end. The FSA’s simplicity, comprehensiveness, and progressivity sets it apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, there’s room for improvement. The most obvious change would be to make it a truly universal child allowance by removing the phase-out and benefit cap; this would cost &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2021/02/05/romneys-child-caps-and-phase-outs-are-pointless/&quot;&gt;$7 billion&lt;/a&gt;. The phase-out is a tax on parents, which would be better applied to all people of that income, including people without children. The benefit cap deprives children born to large families of assistance that would help them thrive, and encourages divorce among couples with many children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more revenue, some rare cases of low-income people who get the maximum EITC could also be made whole. While the FSA is a net benefit to nearly all poor people, replacing the EITC with the FSA earner credit leaves some of these people worse off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Neal proposal is deficit-funded, those deficit dollars could stack atop the FSA to make these changes and increase the child allowance amount. This combined proposal would cut poverty and inequality more than either policy on its own would. Funding these expansions with more tax revenue or benefit reforms could also protect its budget-neutrality and chance for permanence through reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;investment-in-our-future&quot;&gt;Investment in our future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The large antipoverty benefits of the FSA align with our research showing how &lt;a href=&quot;https://child-allowance.ubicenter.org/simulation.html&quot;&gt;child allowances reduce poverty&lt;/a&gt;. Studies from around the world show that child poverty reduction improves child health (physical and mental), child development, educational attainment, earnings as adults, and even lifespan. The policy would reduce adult poverty, too, while shrinking the affordability barrier to people forming the families they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permanent policies like the FSA will durably reduce poverty and inequality, while creating a precedent for the US government to send monthly cash transfers. Building on this foundation will continue to improve the progressivity, efficiency, legibility, empowerment, and effectiveness of the American tax and benefit system.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Niskanen Center modeled the child allowance, worker credit, CTC, EITC, TANF, and HoH changes, which explain nearly all of the poverty impacts, using the Current Population Survey March Supplement. They used the Policy Simulation Library’s Tax-Calculator to do so, though this involved data processing outside Tax-Calculator as well; issues &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/issues/2546&quot;&gt;#2546&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/issues/2546&quot;&gt;#2547&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/issues/2546&quot;&gt;#2548&lt;/a&gt; would simplify this and make it available on Compute Studio. Their analysis did not consider potential labor supply effects. The CDCTC and (especially) SALT repeals would be more accurately modeled with the IRS Public Use File, which contains higher-quality tax data. I did this with the Policy Simulation Library’s Tax-Brain tool to identify distributional impacts by decile. The SNAP categorical eligibility changes would be more difficult to model, and may be best done with the restricted TRIM3 tool, run by the Department of Health and Human Services. Niskanen did not produce distributional charts by decile, and my Tax-Brain analysis did not provide poverty impacts; neither quantified the share of people who benefit, nor their effective marginal tax rates. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Niskanen used the Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) from 2019. Unlike the Official Poverty Measure, the SPM accounts for taxes, transfers, and housing costs. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Author’s calculations based on the Policy Simulation Library’s Tax-Calculator software via the Tax-Brain app on Compute Studio. Data is from the IRS Public Use File, extrapolated to represent the year 2021. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Supplemental Poverty Measure subtracts childcare costs, capped relative to income, when calculating resources. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is remembered chiefly for his leadership of the civil rights movement,
but toward the end of his life, King extended this leadership to the cause of poverty.
In his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thekinglegacy.org/books/where-do-we-go-here-chaos-or-community&quot;&gt;final book&lt;/a&gt;,
he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-{epigraph}&quot;&gt;The time has come for us to civilize ourselves by the total, direct and immediate abolition of poverty [...] 
I'm now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective — the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.

-- Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., *Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?* (1967)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We honor King’s call by showing how a universal basic income (UBI), funded by a flat income tax, would not only reduce overall poverty, but also shrink the poverty disparities between Black and White people. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:modeling&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:modeling&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black Americans today are 75 percent more likely to be in poverty than White Americans, with a rate of 18.4 percent compared to 10.5 percent.
A $250 monthly UBI would cut both Black and White poverty roughly in half (this is similar to what we found in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/how-universal-basic-income-would-affect-the-black-white-poverty-and-wealth-gaps-452e2af1497b&quot;&gt;July 2020 post&lt;/a&gt;, which used older data and did not simulate taxes to fund the UBI).
A $1,000 monthly UBI funded by a flat income tax would reduce poverty for both White and Black people to about 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poverty rate only tells part of the story, though.
When someone goes from deep in poverty to just below the poverty line, the poverty rate is left unchanged, despite the person’s material conditions improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative measure is the &lt;em&gt;poverty gap&lt;/em&gt;, which aggregates each household’s difference between its resources and its poverty threshold. This counts improvements of people who remain in poverty, and can be thought of as the total amount of money required to lift everyone out of poverty, if that money could be perfectly targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying this measure and adjusting for population differences, the Black poverty gap exceeds the White poverty gap by 50 percent: $654 per person, vs. $434 per person.
Given a $250 monthly UBI, which cuts poverty rates in half, poverty gaps also fall by about half, and the difference falls such that the Black poverty gap is about 36 percent higher.
For UBIs above $600 per month, the Black poverty gap even falls below the White poverty gap, likely due to Black people living in areas with lower-cost housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. King didn’t live to see today’s renaissance of guaranteed income, with pandemic responses including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stimulus-check-600-2000-dollars-eligibility-2021-1-1/&quot;&gt;generous unconditional cash transfers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mayorsforagi.org&quot;&gt;mayors across America&lt;/a&gt; calling for pilots, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1316702/nicola-sturgeon-news-scotland-ubi-Universal-Basic-Income-SNP-latest-economy&quot;&gt;leaders across the world&lt;/a&gt; embracing the idea.
But our analysis validates his intuition and the intertwining of his racial justice and economic justice emphases: guaranteed income will produce not only a less impoverished world, but also a less racially disparate one.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Data was gathered from the US Census Bureau’s March Supplement, which covers economic circumstances in 2019. We use the Supplemental Poverty Measure, which incorporates taxes and transfers (including in-kind benefits like SNAP), and adjusts for local housing costs. The flat income tax is applied on positive adjusted gross income. We calculate per-capita poverty gaps by race as the total poverty gap of SPM units with at least one person of that race, divided by the number of people in SPM units with at least one person of that race. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:modeling&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="/ubi-centers-2020-year-in-review">&lt;h4 id=&quot;our-work-studies-from-other-researchers-and-the-biggest-ubi-news-from-the-pastyear&quot;&gt;Our work, studies from other researchers, and the biggest UBI news from the past year&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 has been a devastating year. Covid-19 has killed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/&quot;&gt;nearly two million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, thrown &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2020/10/07/global-action-urgently-needed-to-halt-historic-threats-to-poverty-reduction&quot;&gt;tens of millions&lt;/a&gt; into extreme poverty, and disrupted virtually every aspect of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has also changed perceptions of social protection programs. With millions unable to work safely, populations are more open to unconditional cash transfers, and governments have delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have continued to investigate how societies could adopt universal basic income policies, and fueled by our biggest growth year (we now have &lt;a href=&quot;about/our-team&quot;&gt;ten researchers&lt;/a&gt;), we’ve contributed with policy simulations and evidence reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following up on our &lt;a href=&quot;what-we-learned-about-basic-income-in-2019&quot;&gt;2019 review&lt;/a&gt;, this post summarizes our work from the past year, along with studies from other researchers and the biggest UBI news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ubi-centerresearch&quot;&gt;UBI Center research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-simulation&quot;&gt;Policy simulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our bread-and-butter simulations of UBI policy became more targeted, robust, and policy-relevant throughout 2020. Our simulations showed how UBI would shrink &lt;a href=&quot;how-universal-basic-income-would-affect-the-black-white-poverty-and-wealth-gaps&quot;&gt;black-white poverty and wealth gaps&lt;/a&gt;, how it would affect &lt;a href=&quot;ada30&quot;&gt;people with disabilities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;indigenous&quot;&gt;Indigenous Americans&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;veterans&quot;&gt;Veterans&lt;/a&gt;, and how a &lt;a href=&quot;https://child-allowance.ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;child allowance&lt;/a&gt; would cut child poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-01-01-ubi-centers-2020-year-in-review-0.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first paper of the Covid era showed how different UBI policy designs could &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBICenter/covid19/master/UBI_for_Covid_19.pdf&quot;&gt;stabilize the poverty rate&lt;/a&gt; amid income-lowering recessions, and our latest analysis showed how replacing our existing tax code with a &lt;a href=&quot;us-flat-tax&quot;&gt;flat income tax&lt;/a&gt; could be made progressive with a UBI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-01-01-ubi-centers-2020-year-in-review-1.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also compared UBI to other policies (given a fixed budget), finding that it would be more progressive than &lt;a href=&quot;student-debt&quot;&gt;canceling student debt&lt;/a&gt;, and likely more progressive than expanding additional US &lt;a href=&quot;http://covid.ubicenter.org/fpuc&quot;&gt;unemployment benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-research&quot;&gt;Other research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, we expanded our research portfolio beyond policy simulation to other topics related to UBI. We produced &lt;a href=&quot;canada-homelessness-experiment&quot;&gt;novel analyses&lt;/a&gt; and context of a cash transfer experiment targeting Canadians experiencing homelessness. To inform Democratic primaries, we &lt;a href=&quot;basic-income-plans-from-congressional-candidates-mike-broihier-and-suraj-patel&quot;&gt;summarized&lt;/a&gt; candidates’ stances on UBI. And we tracked and summarized all 27 emergency cash transfer proposals in the US (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalance.com/pandemic-tests-universal-basic-income-5078483&quot;&gt;coverage&lt;/a&gt; of our tracker in The Balance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-01-01-ubi-centers-2020-year-in-review-2.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also integrated deeper non-simulation analysis into simulation projects. Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://child-allowance.ubicenter.org/empirical&quot;&gt;child allowance project&lt;/a&gt; summarized dozens of papers on the impacts of child poverty, while our &lt;a href=&quot;us-flat-tax&quot;&gt;flat tax project&lt;/a&gt; included original statistical analysis of tax and transfer policies associated with inequality reduction among OECD countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-01-01-ubi-centers-2020-year-in-review-3.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;open-source-contributions&quot;&gt;Open source contributions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re the first and only economic policy think tank to open-source all of our work, and we take pride in using and contributing to open source software for economic policy research. This year, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pslmodels.org&quot;&gt;Policy Simulation Library&lt;/a&gt; accepted two of our Python packages — &lt;a href=&quot;http://pslmodels.github.io/openfisca-uk&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;microdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;for analyzing survey data, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pslmodels.github.io/openfisca-uk&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openfisca-uk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for simulating UK economic policy — to its catalog, adding two of our staff to its leadership council. We also created new incubating models to work with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PSLmodels/scf&quot;&gt;US Survey of Consumer Finances&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nikhilwoodruff/frs&quot;&gt;UK Family Resources Survey&lt;/a&gt;. Our researchers contributed to several open source projects on GitHub, from improving documentation in PSL’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/pull/2420&quot;&gt;Tax-Calculator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-USA/pull/634&quot;&gt;OG-USA&lt;/a&gt; economic models to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mwburke/stargazer/pull/53&quot;&gt;enhancing&lt;/a&gt; Python’s support for producing publication-grade regression tables. Finally, we made our own research more open and reproducible by moving most content to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jupyterbook.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter-Book&lt;/a&gt;, which shows hideable code within the interactive web document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;outreach&quot;&gt;Outreach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shared our research in numerous forums: op-eds in The Hill on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/514672-would-basic-income-be-better-than-additional-unemployment-benefits&quot;&gt;unemployment benefit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/opinion/education/529953-child-allowance-would-boost-gdp&quot;&gt;child allowance&lt;/a&gt; analyses; presentations at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1456wwH-W24gXrfOhvDRCHyqZRhelUx64XTrXj-HQRYw/edit#slide=id.g6293382480_0_338&quot;&gt;Tax Economists Forum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/WoHnOqFu6KQ&quot;&gt;PyData Global&lt;/a&gt; conference, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/lL17YLCGSxs&quot;&gt;Social Giving&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/MtDjRauJmE8&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCK_xw0IMDs&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;my-nerds-for-humanity-interview-on-basic-income&quot;&gt;channels&lt;/a&gt;. We also launched our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://us3.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=ffee9994a6979a91e881b8c13&amp;amp;id=938462295c&quot;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; and YouTube &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg0PhP-7kCHtAjcVc7XfTfA&quot;&gt;channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;plans-for2021&quot;&gt;Plans for 2021&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021 promises to be an even bigger year, with upcoming simulations of UBI in the UK, benchmarks of UBI against competing policies, macroeconomic and behavioral effects, interactive tools, events and partnerships, a new website, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;external-research&quot;&gt;External research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reviews-andtools&quot;&gt;Reviews and tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://basicincome.stanford.edu/uploads/Umbrella%20Review%20BI_final.pdf&quot;&gt;Stanford Basic Income Lab UBI study cross-synthesis&lt;/a&gt; affirmed that UBI-type programs alleviate poverty, improve health and education outcomes, while having minimal effects on labour market participation. It nominated understanding of the “tradeoffs between UBI and other programs,” and particularly the impact of “financing a UBI through new revenue streams or diversions from existing programs” as a key gap in the existing research — precisely the gap our research aims to close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cash transfer evidence base also became more navigable with the creation of new tools to access studies that address the impact of cash transfer. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://basicincome.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Basic Income Lab&lt;/a&gt; expanded its platform, providing new &lt;a href=&quot;https://basicincome.stanford.edu/research/ubi-visualization/&quot;&gt;visualizations&lt;/a&gt; that allow users to dive into studies related to UBIs categorized by outcome. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt; created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/cash-research-explorer/&quot;&gt;Cash Research Explorer&lt;/a&gt; that enables users to filter and sort a large database of existing cash transfer studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-simulations&quot;&gt;Policy simulations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcomed not being the only UBI simulators in town, with studies on various policy designs being conducted around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, Columbia University’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/&quot;&gt;Center on Poverty &amp;amp; Social Policy&lt;/a&gt; released a series of policy briefs on how a guaranteed income would affect poverty, comparing recent policy proposals and addressing child inclusion in a carbon tax and universal dividend program. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/01/30/how-a-vat-could-tax-the-rich-and-pay-for-universal-basic-income/&quot;&gt;simulation from Brookings&lt;/a&gt; found 10% VAT could reduce the debt by $2.9 trillion over 10 years, boost means-tested programs and Social Security, and provide a UBI at 20% of the poverty line, raising bottom-quintile income by 17%. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w27351&quot;&gt;dynamic macro model&lt;/a&gt; found that most Americans would prefer UBI today, but future generations would not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1035304620964272&quot;&gt;Australian study&lt;/a&gt; found that an “affluence-tested” UBI would reduce inequality and poverty to levels similar to Nordic welfare states, requiring an increase in taxation to approximately the OECD average. Other simulations in &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41825-017-0007-2&quot;&gt;Gulf states&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://works.bepress.com/widerquist/119/&quot;&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt; showed similarly egalitarian results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimal taxation papers continued to study policies that rebate excess revenue as UBI. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w28098&quot;&gt;One such paper&lt;/a&gt; found that optimal tax rates and welfare rise when incorporating uncertainty around labor responses, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w27622&quot;&gt;another from NBER&lt;/a&gt; found that “a uniform flat tax on capital and labor income combined with a lump-sum transfer is nearly optimal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resilience-and-adherence-covid-19&quot;&gt;Resilience and adherence: COVID-19&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a difficult year in which COVID-19 brought economies around the world to a standstill, we learned more about how cash transfers can create resilience to income shocks. The continuation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt;’s UBI experiment in Kenya during the COVID-19 crisis offered the opportunity to estimate the impact of unconditional cash transfers to poor families. As the first true UBI experiment in history — guaranteeing payments that meet basic needs for each member of randomly selected villages for up to 12 years — its first results deserve special attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~pniehaus/papers/ubi_covid.pdf&quot;&gt;Banerjee et al.&lt;/a&gt; found that the UBI, which began in 2016, significantly reduced recipient hunger, sickness and depression in spite of the pandemic, though with modest effect sizes. It also reduced hospital visits and decreased social interactions, indicating that access to a UBI offered people a greater capacity to follow public health recommendations about social distancing and thereby likely reduced contagion rates. While recipients lost the income gains from starting non-agricultural enterprises during the pandemic, they suffered smaller increases in hunger, indicating that the UBI induced recipients to accept more income risk by mitigating the effects of adverse income shocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mental-health&quot;&gt;Mental health&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, numerous studies shed light on how cash transfers can reduce stress, improve self-reported well-being and enable participants to make more rational long-term economic decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kela.fi/web/en/news-archive/-/asset_publisher/lN08GY2nIrZo/content/results-of-the-basic-income-experiment-small-employment-effects-better-perceived-economic-security-and-mental-wellbeing&quot;&gt;basic income experiment&lt;/a&gt;, which was carried out in 2017–18, reported this year that basic income recipients were more satisfied with their lives, experienced less mental strain and had a more positive perception of their economic welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a developing context, &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jae/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jae/ejaa010/6015888&quot;&gt;Molotsky and Handa&lt;/a&gt; found that national cash transfers in Malawi reduced stress and improved positive affect among recipients; these psychological effects directly impacted on economic decision-making, encouraging recipients to make more long term decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w28106&quot;&gt;Haushofer et al., 2020b&lt;/a&gt; found that cash transfers in rural Kenya outperformed more costly psychotherapy programs both in economic and psychological well-being outcomes, and that a combination of cash transfers and psychotherapy was no more effective than cash alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304387818310289?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;Haushofer et al., 2020a&lt;/a&gt; found that in Nairobi, free health insurance outperformed a uniform cash transfer of the same value in reducing self-reported stress and cortisol levels, though the most conservative statistical bounds render the difference statistically insignificant. It found no effect of either program on other economic and health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large-scale &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/uploads/1/0/9/9/109970865/cash_transfer_meta-analysis_working_paper_1.53.pdf&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that cash transfers improved self-reported subjective well-being and mental health and that the higher the transfer, the greater the impact. Unconditional cash transfers outperformed conditional cash transfers. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6522/eaay0214?rss%253D1=&quot;&gt;review in Science Magazine&lt;/a&gt; found that “cash transfers and broader antipoverty programs reduce depression and anxiety in randomized trials […] poverty experienced in childhood and in utero [results] in impaired cognitive development and adult mental illness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-effects-of-cash-transfers&quot;&gt;Other effects of cash transfers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voluminous literature on cash transfers continued to grow rapidly in 2020. Here are a sample of influential papers from the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28074/w28074.pdf&quot;&gt;multifaceted intervention&lt;/a&gt; that included a cash transfer for 30 to 40 weeks improved consumption, food security, income, and health for up to a decade. In Mexico, cash transfers &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uYloKO69ESDXHIU5n-1XmiLK3APrMs0_/view&quot;&gt;halved homicides&lt;/a&gt; on hot days by reducing stress and increasing air conditioning. In Rwanda, cash transfers &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01749&quot;&gt;outperformed&lt;/a&gt; a USAID workforce readiness program on key outcomes like income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, the 1990s retraction of cash assistance to poor mothers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w28077&quot;&gt;worsened child-parent interactions&lt;/a&gt; (the effect was not traced to changes in the mother’s labor supply). The Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w26712&quot;&gt;increased fertility&lt;/a&gt; (births per woman) by 13 percent after its introduction, mostly among women aged 20 to 44.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conditionality-and-targeting&quot;&gt;Conditionality and targeting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X20300024#f0010&quot;&gt;New evidence&lt;/a&gt; from the Kenya Cash Transfer Programme for Orphans and Vulnerable Children for at-risk children shows that enforcing compliance with health conditions with monitoring and fines doesn’t improve program effectiveness compared to ‘labelling’ transfers — providing suggestions for how recipients should use transfers. The study also showed that fines had regressive impacts. Among the poorest transfer recipients, fines for noncompliance were associated with a significant decline in non-food consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers also quantified the cost of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wagner.nyu.edu/impact/research/publications/program-recertification-costs-evidence-snap&quot;&gt;administrative burdens&lt;/a&gt; for SNAP recipients in the US, and the New York Times centered this research in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/28/upshot/administrative-burden-quiz.html&quot;&gt;interactive story&lt;/a&gt;. The Jain Family Institute published two papers in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jainfamilyinstitute.org/projects/from-idea-to-reality-the-future-of-guaranteed-income/&quot;&gt;series on guaranteed income&lt;/a&gt;, describing implementation of guaranteed income in the US and a framework for considering what programs the guaranteed income could suitably replace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;polls&quot;&gt;Polls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pollsters asked people from all over the world how they felt about UBI and cash transfers, and the timing of these polls showed how Covid-19 affected sentiments toward the welfare state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first polls came from the US, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheUBICenter/status/1245575691082428423&quot;&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;, 63% of people aged 18–36 supported a universal basic income of $1,000 per month for adults. Data for Progress &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/3/19/voters-want-the-government-to-send-everyone-1000&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that net support for sending each American a check for $1,000 rose from -15 to +32 between March 2 and March 17, when the gravity of the pandemic became apparent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/3/21/voters-support-a-robust-cash-payment&quot;&gt;Also in March&lt;/a&gt;, Data for Progress found that Americans prefer ongoing payments to one-time payments by a 38-point margin, and between monthly payments of (a) $2,000/adult + $1,000/child and (b) $1,000/adult, voters prefer the larger amount by a 15-point margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polls outside the US found majority support for the policy, too. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://eupinions.eu/de/text/in-crisis-europeans-support-radical-positions&quot;&gt;March poll&lt;/a&gt; found that 71% of Europeans support UBI; an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/5y7qpjzd6v/NEON_CoronavirusClimate_200417_W.pdf&quot;&gt;April poll&lt;/a&gt; found that 51% of Brits supported it; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.probe-research.com/polls/manitobans-support-universal-basic-income-higher-taxes-high-income-earners-and-larger&quot;&gt;also in April&lt;/a&gt;, 62% of Manitoba, Canada residents supported UBI; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-11/survey-says-most-australians-welcome-universal-basic-income/12970924&quot;&gt;as of October&lt;/a&gt;, 58% of Australians supported it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news&quot;&gt;News&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;calls-forubi&quot;&gt;Calls for UBI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government leaders and other influential people and organizations called for UBI pilots and policies, especially relating to (but not limited to) the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most forceful voices came from the UK. The Liberal Democrats (the third largest party, which received &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_breakdown_of_the_2019_United_Kingdom_general_election&quot;&gt;12 percent of votes&lt;/a&gt; in 2019) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libdems.org.uk/a20-ubi&quot;&gt;endorsed UBI&lt;/a&gt; in September, and in October, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubilabnetwork.org/letter-to-rishi-sunak&quot;&gt;over 500 MPs, peers and councillors&lt;/a&gt; requested that the Chancellor support UBI trials. Throughout the year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/31/covid-job-losses-lead-mps-to-call-for-trials-of-universal-basic-income&quot;&gt;several councils&lt;/a&gt; campaigned to launch UBI pilots in their areas, including Liverpool, Brighton, Leeds, Norwich and Belfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders in Canada have been similarly enthusiastic. Canada has a rich history of unconditional cash transfers: they created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200624-canadas-forgotten-universal-basic-income-experiment&quot;&gt;Mincome experiment&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s, a UBI pilot in the province of Ontario (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/making-sense/ontario-is-canceling-its-basic-income-experiment&quot;&gt;prematurely cancelled&lt;/a&gt; in 2019), a generous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubiworks.ca/ccb&quot;&gt;child benefit&lt;/a&gt;, and the CERB program providing CAD 2,000 (USD 1,570) per month through September to people who’d lost employment due to Covid-19. In July, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/now-is-the-time-to-bring-a-basic-income-program-to-canada-says-b-c-senator-but-the-pilot-project-could-cost-100-million&quot;&gt;British Columbia Senator Yuen Pau&lt;/a&gt; Woo suggested testing UBI, and in the same month, the Senate national finance committee released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://sencanada.ca/en/info-page/parl-43-1/nffn-covid-19-relief-in-times-of-crisis/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the need for UBI. In September, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/09/15/coalition-calls-on-federal-liberals-to-bring-in-a-basic-income-to-address-gender-inequity.html&quot;&gt;a coalition&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 4,000 individuals and organizations called on the federal government to work toward UBI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, several members of Congress called for one-time and recurring unconditional payments amid Covid-19 (see our &lt;a href=&quot;http://covid19tracker.ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;tracker&lt;/a&gt;), including a proposal for $2,000 monthly checks per person from Senator Bernie Sanders and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. The one-time relief payments of $1,200 from March were renewed at $600 in the December bill, along with flat payments of $300 per week for unemployed people (down from $600 from April through July). The governor of Alaska also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/12/14/dunleavy-proposes-nearly-5000-in-dividends-for-alaskans-cuts-other-state-spending/&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; increasing the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend from its normal value of $1,000-$3,000 to $5,000 due to the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro-UBI US voices were elevated in 2021, too. In April, Jack Dorsey created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/7/21212757/coronavirus-jack-dorsey-charity-billion-llc&quot;&gt;$1 billion philanthropic fund&lt;/a&gt; from his holdings in Square; the fund has since grown to $3.7 billion, of which he’s spent $330 million, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uT6Tw0lrYMj9YSQpkMAyf_i31Urf0IWW5wIJ76Rckv8/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;$44 million&lt;/a&gt; for UBI pilots. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1286675223434141697&quot;&gt;Pro-UBI&lt;/a&gt; Elon Musk became the world’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/12/08/elon-musk-passes-bernard-arnault-to-become-the-worlds-second-richest-person/?sh=ab0da895cb0d&quot;&gt;second wealthiest person&lt;/a&gt; in December. Andrew Yang, who centered his presidential campaign on UBI (we &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d8dab818bf1b&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/a-revenue-neutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d7d517dbeeea&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/why-some-low-income-people-come-out-behind-in-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-c95d0f1cc433&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://plans.ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt; on his plan in 2019), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/11/politics/andrew-yang-ends-2020-presidential-campaign/index.html&quot;&gt;ended his presidential campaign&lt;/a&gt; in February, but he is &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/531337-poll-finds-andrew-yang-favored-for-new-york-city-mayor&quot;&gt;now the favorite&lt;/a&gt; for New York City’s 2021 mayoral race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders in various other countries have supported UBI as well. In March, one of Australia’s largest unions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8154513/Australian-union-pushes-universal-income-740-week.html&quot;&gt;called for a guaranteed income&lt;/a&gt; throughout the pandemic, structured as a job guarantee plus AUD 740 (USD 725) per week for people who don’t participate in the job guarantee program. In South Africa, the governing party &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.groundup.org.za/media/uploads/documents/anc_nec_stsc_big-1.pdf&quot;&gt;highlighted&lt;/a&gt; the need for a UBI, but plans for a 2020 policy were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-economy-universalincomegrant/south-africa-will-not-have-universal-basic-income-grant-this-year-minister-says-idUSKCN24W2WK&quot;&gt;scrapped in July&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the United Nations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cepal.org/en/publications/45544-social-challenge-times-covid-19&quot;&gt;Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; and UN Development Program’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/05/1063312&quot;&gt;Asia-Pacific bureau&lt;/a&gt; have called for UBI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;guaranteed-income-initiatives&quot;&gt;Guaranteed income initiatives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to one-time payments and ongoing payments to unemployed people like those in the US and Canada, several governments and nonprofits are sending regular cash payments to broad sets of people without requiring work history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayorsforagi.org/&quot;&gt;Mayors for a Guaranteed Income&lt;/a&gt; — which now includes over 30 mayors — is driving a number of new philanthropically-funded guaranteed income pilots, including in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-18/800-compton-residents-to-get&quot;&gt;Compton&lt;/a&gt;, and established the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sp2.upenn.edu/center-for-guaranteed-income-research-recently-launched/&quot;&gt;Center for Guaranteed Income Research&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Pennsylvania. &lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/2020/10/13/san-francisco-will-pay-artists-1000-a-month-in-universal-basic-income/&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://basicincometoday.com/long-beach-moves-ahead-with-guaranteed-basic-income-for-some-artists/&quot;&gt;Long Beach&lt;/a&gt; will also both give basic incomes to artists (see our comments in coverage of the San Francisco program). But the nonprofit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/covid-19/us/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt; has already distributed the most — since March, they’ve transferred $1,000 to each of 134,000 SNAP recipients, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GiveDirectly-End-of-Year-Update.pdf?utm_source=email&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=202012eoyupdatematch&amp;amp;utm_content=eoy_update&quot;&gt;99% efficiency&lt;/a&gt; and an average of two days between enrollment and first payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GiveDirectly also delivered transfers to over 500,000 recipients outside the US, creating new contact-free payment models and adding new programs. For example, they provided USAID-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liberianobserver.com/news/givedirectly-educational-stipends-for-12th-graders-writing-the-wassce-exam/&quot;&gt;educational stipends&lt;/a&gt; of $50 to 37,000 12th-graders in every high school in Liberia, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90585079/how-givedirectly-is-finding-the-poorest-people-in-the-world-and-sending-them-cash&quot;&gt;applied machine learning&lt;/a&gt; to identify and pay extremely poor households in Togo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-economics/brazils-government-backs-new-basic-income-payments-to-poor-idUKKBN26J381&quot;&gt;expanding&lt;/a&gt; its Bolsa Familia cash transfer into a new program called Renda Cidada (“citizen income”), and Bogota, Colombia, is giving cash and food aid to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2020/11/17/claudia-lopez-on-the-acceleration-of-social-innovation&quot;&gt;over 700,000 households&lt;/a&gt;. Spain introduced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/5/30/spain-introduces-basic-income-scheme-to-tackle-poverty&quot;&gt;minimum income program&lt;/a&gt; that intended to benefit over 2 million individuals, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/news/spain-struggles-to-put-in-place-basic-income-scheme-01598763004&quot;&gt;implementation challenges&lt;/a&gt; are slowing it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On most measures, 2021 has a low bar to clear to outdo 2020. Given this array of studies, UBI research might not be one of those measures, but we expect even more simulations, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and new programs to inform UBI policy design and how UBI compares to the status quo and alternatives.
